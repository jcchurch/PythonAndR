# Data Analysis with Python and R

Hi. I will be using GitHub as our course website. At the top of the screen is
a tab called "Wiki". Click on "Wiki" to see our course information.

Our course syllabus is under the course_documents directory. I've left the
syllabus in both LaTeX and PDF for your reading pleasure.

Any code used in courses will be found in one of the other directories.
